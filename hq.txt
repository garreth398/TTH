Very little is needed to make a happy life; it is all within yourself, in your way of thinking.
I am determined to be cheerful and happy in whatever situation I may find myself. For I have learned that the greater part of our misery or unhappiness is determined not by our circumstance but by our disposition.
To be happy, we must not be too concerned with others.
It’s a helluva start, being able to recognize what makes you happy.
Sometimes your joy is the source of your smile, but sometimes your smile can be the source of your joy.
Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time.
Happy people plan actions, they don’t plan results
The only joy in the world is to begin.
Nobody can be uncheered with a balloon
